#article World_Description
#caption World
The world of "Knights of Honor II: Sovereign" (and the Example Mod) is a stylized depiction of the medieval "old world" â€” Europe, northern Africa and the near east (Western Asia).
{p}This territory is split into provinces, each ruled by a kingdom. A kingdom can  have many provinces, but a province cannot be split and is always ruled by a single kingdom. The oceans and seas are always neutral and no one can own them.
{p}Each province, as well as each kingdom, has a religion and culture, and those of a province can differ from those of the kingdom that owns the province, which can lead to some local tension. The important features of each province are its town, settlements, geography and province features.
